            <p>This company sells custom designed guitars that are either based off of japanese culture or animation. The name Trandscendence represents an experience beyond the normal or physical which is how some people feel when they listen to music that hits home. Musicians also feel this when they get to play/create the songs they want to and they get a sense of acievement when they complete it. We ususally deliver in 3 to 5 working days</p>
